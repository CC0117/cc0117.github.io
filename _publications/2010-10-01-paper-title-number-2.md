MambaVesselNet introduces a hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture for 3D cerebrovascular segmentation in MRI images. By combining the strength of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction with the Mamba block for modeling long-range dependencies, the proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

### **Key Contributions**
1. A novel Hybrid CNN-Mamba model for 3D medical image segmentation.
2. State-of-the-art performance on public cerebrovascular datasets.
3. Improved computational efficiency with selective state space modeling.
