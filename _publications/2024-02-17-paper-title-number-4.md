### **Abstract**
This study examines users' perceptions of the use of biosignal feedback to monitor cybersickness and investigates the effective integration of biosignal visualizations within virtual reality environments. The impact of biofeedback on user experience was examined through the development of two biosignal visualizations and a controlled study. The findings revealed that the provision of avatar feedback had a markedly beneficial effect on the user experience within the virtual reality setting. Those who received avatar feedback reported experiencing a more positive emotional state, heightened presence, increased attentional focus, and reduced levels of distraction in comparison to those who did not receive any feedback. Additionally, the majority of participants indicated a clear preference for avatar-based feedback over environmental feedback. Moreover, a series of interviews were conducted to investigate the efficacy and perception of biofeedback across diverse scenarios, as well as its potential applications in evaluating physical states and guiding actions in virtual reality. The findings of this study provide valuable insights that will inform future research and assist practitioners in designing more efficacious biosignal visualizations for the management of cybersickness in virtual reality.

### **Key Contributions**
- Investigated the efficacy of biofeedback systems for monitoring cybersickness in VR environments and their impact on user experience.
- Designed and evaluated two biofeedback visualization methods: avatar-based feedback and environment-based feedback.
- Conducted a controlled study to compare user experiences across three conditions: avatar feedback, environment feedback, and no feedback.
- Demonstrated that avatar feedback significantly improved user experience by enhancing emotional state, presence, and attentional focus while reducing distraction levels compared to other feedback conditions.
- Identified key user preferences and challenges related to biofeedback systems, offering design implications for future VR applications.
