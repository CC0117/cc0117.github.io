I obtained my BSc in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/). I am an incoming M.S. student in Health Informatics at Yale University.  My research interests lie in biomedical image analysis and AI applications for healthcare. Previously, I worked as a part-time Research Assistant at the CVIP Lab, collaborating closely with [Prof. Xiangjiang He](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BiBXGfIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Saeid Pourroostaei Ardakani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3OeHr8gAAAAJ&hl=en).

## **Research Interests**
1. Biomedical Image Analysis.
2. General-Purpose Vision Architectures: Exploring transformer-inspired models to understand how overall architectural design, rather than specific token-mixing mechanisms, drives performance in medical image segmentation task and beyond.
