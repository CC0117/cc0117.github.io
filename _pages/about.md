I am a Computer Science graduate from the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/), specializing in applying AI and computer vision to biomedical imaging. My research focuses on developing innovative solutions for healthcare diagnostics and accessibility.

### **Research Interests**
1. **Biomedical Image Analysis:**.
2. **General-Purpose Vision Architectures:** Exploring transformer-inspired models to understand how overall architectural design, rather than specific token-mixing mechanisms, drives performance in tasks like medical image segmentation and beyond.  
3. **(Deep) Reinforcement Learning:** I am also interested in (deep) reinforcement learning and its various applications.
