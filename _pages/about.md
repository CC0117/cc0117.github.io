I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Health Informatics at Yale University. Before Yale, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant in the CVIP Lab, where I collaborated with [Prof. Xiangjian He](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BiBXGfIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Saeid Pourroostaei Ardakani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3OeHr8gAAAAJ&hl=en).  

My research focuses on biomedical image analysis and AI-driven solutions for healthcare. I am particularly interested in developing general-purpose vision architectures and clinical informatics methods that can advance medical diagnostics and healthcare accessibility.  

<!-- 
## **Research Interests**
1. Biomedical Image Analysis.
2. General-Purpose Vision Architectures: Exploring transformer-inspired models to understand how overall architectural design, rather than specific token-mixing mechanisms, drives performance in medical image segmentation task and beyond.   -->
